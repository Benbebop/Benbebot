[Chorus]
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you wanna stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's

[Verse 2]
We're really quite surprised
We get to see you another night
You should have looked for another job
You should have said to this place goodbye
It's like there's so much more
Maybe you've been in this place before
We remember a face like yours
You seem acquainted with those doors

[Pre-Chorus]
Please let us get in
Don't lock us away
We're not like what you're thinking
We're poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we're forced here to take that role!
We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone since 1987
Join us, be our friend or just be stuck and defend
After all, you only got
[Chorus]
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's, oh
[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I last have seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter
Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So I could ponder
The sanity of your mother

[Verse 2]
I wish I lived in the present
With the gift of my past mistakes
But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes
Your sweet little eyes, your little smile is all I remember
Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper

[Pre-Chorus]
Justification is killing me, but killing isn't justified
What happened to my son? I'm terrified
It lingers in my mind and the thought keeps on getting bigger
I'm sorry, my sweet baby, I wish I'd been there

[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I last have seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter
Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So I could ponder
The sanity of your mother
(Now I gotta deal with this shit)
Ayy, yo, y'all boobas must be out your fuckin' mind (Yo, yo, old shitty-dick ass boobas)
Thinking dog can't pull another motherfuckin' rabbit out the hat (Yo, y'all boobas is fucking dumb)
Think I ain't got a trick up my motherfuckin' sleeve, you bitch-ass boobas
Fuck these boobas thinking?
Y'all boobas thinkin' I'm doing, just sittin' around doin' nothin'?
Oh my God, boobas can't be serious

[Chorus]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that booba in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them boobas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that booba in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them boobas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
[Post-Chorus]
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 1]
Man, cats don't know (What?) what it's gon' be
Fuckin' with a booba like me
D to the M to the X (X)
Last I heard, y'all boobas was havin' sex (Uh) with the same sex (Woo)
I show no love (Yeah) to homo thugs (Nah)
Empty out, reload, and blow more slugs (Boom)
How you gonna explain fuckin' a man?
Even if we squash the beef, I ain't touchin' your hand (Aight?)
I don't fuck with chumps (Yeah)
For those that been to jail, that's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps (Uh)
I don't fuck with boobas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog (Woo)
I know how to get down, know how to bite (Bite)
Bark very little, but I know how to fight (Fight)
I know how to chase a cat up in a tree
Man, I'll give y'all boobas the business for fuckin' with me
Is you crazy?

[Chorus]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that booba in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them boobas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that booba in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them boobas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
[Post-Chorus]
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2]
Once it's on, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam, blam, lungs is gone, sons will mourn
From dusk 'til dawn (Uh), night time belongs to the dog
On the street past midnight, look for 'em in the morgue (Yeah)
Won't play with these cats 'cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats (Uh)
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats (Aight?)
'Cause I know boobas is hard-headed, but I ain't got the patience (Uh)
Don't want me havin' no patience, turn into more patients
More trips to ICU 'cause I see you
Trying to get away with shit a real booba wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? (Right here)
You see them boobas? (Right where?)
Get 'em, boys (Right there)
That's how we do (Alright, then)
Yeah, this is for my dogs (Uh), this is for my dogs (Uh)
Yo, where we at, baby? (Creepin' through the fog)
From then 'til now, don't ask me how
Know that we gon' roll like them boobas and hit every block on the job

[Chorus]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that booba in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them boobas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that booba in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them boobas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
[Post-Chorus]
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 3]
I get apes doin' crime, stomp boobas like grapes makin' wine (Yeah)
Five CD's with mad rhymes (Aight)
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'
You really wanna stop boobas from dyin'? Stop boobas from tryin' (Yeah)
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face (Aight?)
Lookin' at you in your grill, it might be nice to cut (Uh-huh)
Once I split your ass in two, you'll be twice as butt (Uh-huh)
Yeah, you right, I know your style pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it (Damn)
Since we all here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it (Woo)
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?
Shove your head up your ass, have you seein' shit clearly (Woo)
Never heard that D be running (Uh), 'cause D be gunning
I beat my dick and bust off in your eye so you can see me comin'
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind
And if they get me with the joint, they'll hit me with a three-to-nine

[Chorus]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that booba in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them boobas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that booba in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them boobas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

[Outro]
What?
Where the fuckin' hood at?
Ayy, no one's fuckin' with me, booba (It's all good)
For real (It's all good, dog is the hood)
I am the hood (It's all good, dog in the hood)
I am the streets (It's all good, dog is the hood)
You bitch-ass booba (It's all good, dog is the hood)
Take it how you want, motherfucker (It's all good)
I'm in the hood all day (Dog is the hood)
I think I'm, like, the only booba, dog (Dog in the hood)
That can go to the projects (School Street, Home of the Brave)
By his fuckin' self and be good (Good)
Yeah, booba, ask boobas on my projects (Yo, Y.O.)
When the last time they seen dog, motherfucker (Not too long ago, baby)
D, Y, uh (Y'all boobas is homeless)
Kato (Where the hood at?)
